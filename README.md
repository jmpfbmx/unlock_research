# Unlock research for latest amazon devices

So as u probably know Amazon devices can't be unlocked in general, and you need to use some exploits etc, but this is not possible anymore since they blow an efuse and they also use a BFP that can be just programmed once.

The best will be trying to find which are the blown efuses by amazon and do some hacks at motherboard with resistance for don't make them die, but wbu the BFP, on theory it is being written when u turn it on, so what will happen if efuses are being fixed with resistances and then with a programmer without turning on the device is being written? On theory we will just skip everything that amazon can do and we will can try to find something for doing the unlock.

This have to be tested, as i can't i will just keep it here as an unlock research.
